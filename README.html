Wilson's Kattis solutions, programmed in the PHP language. This directory is set to make the listed .php files viewable as source code. The matching .txt files are sample input files for each problem from the <a href="http://open.kattis.com">Kattis website</a>, which can be supplied to PHP using <a href="kattis.php">kattis.php</a>.<br>
Example: <tt>$ ./kattis.php test oddities</tt> will supply oddities.txt as input into oddities.php and output the result to the console.<br>
<tt>/usr/bin/php</tt> is the PHP CLI binary on the system the tests are being run on.
